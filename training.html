				<p style="font-size:1em; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom: 6px;">
				A six module training program, the first five modules target training team members on the 
				attitude and skills required to consistently deliver quality service that differentiates 
				one establishment from another.  The sixth module is designed to engage the establishment’s 
				leadership team in maintaining and leading the team to exceed customer expectations.  Look 
				for long term achievements from implementing this program as well as the ability to improve 
				short term objectives in service.
				<br/><br/>
				Implementation involves a one day workshop with the management team to prepare for conducting 
				the five modules targeted for service team members.  Modules 1 to 5 can be flexibly scheduled 
				and conducted over a two day, or longer, period of time.  Team training is focused on key 
				competencies to deliver Five Star Service and is evaluated by supervisors prior to certification.

				<p style="font-size:1em; margin-top:20px;">
				Establishing and outlining an effective path for developing people internally for career growth, 
				or, having a plan to attract and recruit new talent is critical in today’s economical climate.  
				How a graduate of a hospitality school views a company can start with an effective summer internship 
				plan that demonstrates a companies commitment to individual career growth.  Graduates do not want 
				to the same position without seeing the opportunity to grow, take on new challenges and achieve 
				greater career success.  
				<br/><br/>
				If you are a company you need a plan for internal promotion that supports strategic growth and is 
				viewed positively by employees.  When recruiting outside the company, this plan can be critical 
				to attracting new, dynamic talent.
				<br/><br/>
				To a hospitality educational program, externships are a part of the learning process where students 
				link theory to practical application.  It can be viewed as necessary credit to graduate or it can 
				be more dynamic by linking students to career choices that best suit their talent.
